Therefore, the sequence starts with `setFeePool` to set the initial fee pool, followed by `changeFeePool` to change it.\n* `transfer`: The `transfer` function requires that the sender has a non-zero balance. Therefore, the sequence starts with `mint` to mint some tokens to the sender, followed by `transfer` to transfer them.\n* `feePoolTransfer`: The `feePoolTransfer` function requires that a fee pool is already set. Therefore, the sequence starts with `setFeePool` to set the initial fee pool, followed by `feePoolTransfer` to transfer tokens from the fee pool.\n* `transferFrom`: The `transferFrom` function requires that the sender has been approved to spend tokens on behalf of the owner. Therefore, the sequence starts with `approve` to approve the sender, followed by `transferFrom` to transfer tokens.\n* `approve`: The `approve` function can be called at any time, but it's more interesting to call it after a `transfer` to approve the sender to spend tokens on behalf of the owner.\n* `increaseAllowance` and `decreaseAllowance`: These functions require that the sender has already been approved to spend tokens on behalf of the owner. Therefore, the sequence starts with `approve` to approve the sender, followed by `increaseAllowance` or `decreaseAllowance` to modify the allowance.\n* `burnFrom`: The `burnFrom` function requires that the sender has been approved to spend tokens on behalf of the owner. Therefore, the sequence starts with `approve` to approve the sender, followed by `burnFrom` to burn tokens from the owner's account.\n\nNote that these sequences are not the only possible ones, but they are some examples of valid sequences that can lead to the execution of the target functions."

Hence, please try to understand the contract code and find a proper sequence for decreaseAllowance.\nburnFrom:['setFeePool', 'changeFeePool', 'mint', 'burnFrom'] is a valid sequence. However,function burnFrom still has the code coverage 91.88679245283019 below the threshold 98. The code coverage does not change after the execution of this sequence. Hence, please try to understand the contract code and find a proper sequence for burnFrom.\n\nBeing aware of the valid sequence(s) and feedback, for each target function in , please re-generate a different function sequence by selecting one from the candidate sequences of this target given in the Iteration 2. If no candidate sequence is found, then you should generate with your best effort a sequence (which has the length falling in [2, 4], starts with a start function, and ends with this target). If you can not generate a sequence, just use [] instead. Please return the sequences in json format: {\"target function\":function sequence,...}. Please also provide explanation after the json content."
