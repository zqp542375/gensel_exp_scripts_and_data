The sequence `[\"increaseApproval\", \"decreaseApproval\"]` achieves this. Note that this sequence is acceptable because we need to increase the approval to a non-zero value before we can decrease it.\n\nNote that these sequences assume that the contract is in a state where the required conditions are met. For example, for `transferFrom` to work, the `mintingFinished` flag must be true, and the `balances` mapping must have a non-zero value for the `_from` address."
