However,function approve still has the code coverage 84.53237410071942 below the threshold 98. The code coverage does not change after the execution of this sequence. Hence, please try to understand the contract code and find a proper sequence for approve.\nincreaseAllowance:['approve', 'mint', 'increaseAllowance'] is invalid. The execution stops at function increaseAllowance. The code coverage of this function so far is 88.88888888888889. The code coverage can be further improved. Please find a proper sequence to increase code coverage for increaseAllowance.\ndecreaseAllowance:['approve', 'setTxFee', 'decreaseAllowance'] is a valid sequence. However,function decreaseAllowance still has the code coverage 88.88888888888889 below the threshold 98. The code coverage does not change after the execution of this sequence. Hence, please try to understand the contract code and find a proper sequence for decreaseAllowance.\nburnFrom:['transfer', 'changeFeePool', 'burnFrom'] is invalid. The execution stops at function changeFeePool. The code coverage of this function so far is 91.88679245283019. The code coverage can be further improved. Please find a proper sequence to increase code coverage for burnFrom.\n\nBeing aware of the valid sequence(s) and feedback, for each target function in , please re-generate a different function sequence by selecting one from the candidate sequences of this target given in the Iteration 2. If no candidate sequence is found, then you should generate with your best effort a sequence (which has the length falling in [2, 4], starts with a start function, and ends with this target). If you can not generate a sequence, just use [] instead. Please return the sequences in json format: {\"target function\":function sequence,...}. Please also provide explanation after the json content."

After analyzing the contract code, I found that the `transfer` function has a conditional statement that checks if the `txFeePerMillion` is not zero. Therefore, I generated a new sequence that sets the `txFeePerMillion` before calling the `transfer` function.\n* `transferFrom`: The previous sequence `['approve', 'setTxFee', 'transferFrom']` did not increase the code coverage. After analyzing the contract code, I found that the `transferFrom` function has a conditional statement that checks if the `spender` balance is not zero. Therefore, I generated a new sequence that mints some tokens before calling the `transferFrom` function to increase the `spender` balance.\n* `feePoolTransfer`: The previous sequence `['setFeePool', 'burn', 'feePoolTransfer']` was invalid. After analyzing the contract code, I found that the `feePoolTransfer` function has a conditional statement that checks if the `feePool` is not zero. Therefore, I generated a new sequence that changes the `feePool` before calling the `feePoolTransfer` function.\n* `approve`: The previous sequence `['mint', 'approve']` did not increase the code coverage. After analyzing the contract code, I found that the `approve` function has a conditional statement that checks if the `spender` is not zero. Therefore, I generated a new sequence that changes the `feePool` before calling the `approve` function to increase the `spender` balance.\n* `increaseAllowance`: The previous sequence `['approve', 'mint', 'increaseAllowance']` was invalid. After analyzing the contract code, I found that the `increaseAllowance` function has a conditional statement that checks if the `spender` balance is not zero. Therefore, I generated a new sequence that sets the `txFeePerMillion` before calling the `increaseAllowance` function to increase the `spender` balance.\n* `decreaseAllowance`: The previous sequence `['approve', 'setTxFee', 'decreaseAllowance']` did not increase the code coverage. After analyzing the contract code, I found that the `decreaseAllowance` function has a conditional statement that checks if the `spender` balance is not zero. Therefore, I generated a new sequence that mints some tokens before calling the `decreaseAllowance` function to increase the `spender` balance.\n* `burnFrom`: The previous sequence `['transfer', 'changeFeePool', 'burnFrom']` was invalid. After analyzing the contract code, I found that the `burnFrom` function has a conditional statement that checks if the `feePool` is not zero. Therefore, I generated a new sequence that changes the `feePool` before calling the `burnFrom` function.\n\nNote that these sequences are not the only possible sequences, but they are one possible way to increase the code coverage for each target function."
