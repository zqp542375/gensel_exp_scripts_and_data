However,function increaseAllowance still has the code coverage 88.88888888888889 below the threshold 98. The code coverage does not change after the execution of this sequence. Hence, please try to understand the contract code and find a proper sequence for increaseAllowance.\ndecreaseAllowance:['transfer', 'decreaseAllowance'] is a valid sequence. However,function decreaseAllowance still has the code coverage 88.88888888888889 below the threshold 98. The code coverage does not change after the execution of this sequence. Hence, please try to understand the contract code and find a proper sequence for decreaseAllowance.\nburnFrom:['increaseAllowance', 'burnFrom'] is a valid sequence. However,function burnFrom still has the code coverage 91.88679245283019 below the threshold 98. The code coverage does not change after the execution of this sequence. Hence, please try to understand the contract code and find a proper sequence for burnFrom.\n\nBeing aware of the valid sequence(s) and feedback, for each target function in , please re-generate a different function sequence by selecting one from the candidate sequences of this target given in the Iteration 2. If no candidate sequence is found, then you should generate with your best effort a sequence (which has the length falling in [2, 4], starts with a start function, and ends with this target). If you can not generate a sequence, just use [] instead. Please return the sequences in json format: {\"target function\":function sequence,...}. Please also provide explanation after the json content."

After analyzing the contract code, I found that the `transfer` function has a conditional statement that checks if the `balance` is sufficient. To cover this branch, I generated a new sequence `['burn', 'transfer']`, which burns tokens before calling `transfer`.\n* `transferFrom`: The previous sequence `['decreaseAllowance', 'transferFrom']` did not increase the code coverage. After analyzing the contract code, I found that the `transferFrom` function requires that the `allowance` is sufficient. To cover this branch, I generated a new sequence `['transfer', 'transferFrom']`, which transfers tokens before calling `transferFrom`.\n* `feePoolTransfer`: The previous sequence `['mint', 'feePoolTransfer']` was invalid. After analyzing the contract code, I found that the `feePoolTransfer` function requires that the `feePool` has a non-zero balance. To cover this branch, I generated a new sequence `['transfer', 'feePoolTransfer']`, which transfers tokens to the `feePool` before calling `feePoolTransfer`.\n* `approve`: The previous sequence `['renounceOwnership', 'approve']` did not increase the code coverage. After analyzing the contract code, I found that the `approve` function has a conditional statement that checks if the `owner` is not the zero address. To cover this branch, I generated a new sequence `['burnFrom', 'approve']`, which burns tokens from the `owner` before calling `approve`.\n* `increaseAllowance`: The previous sequence `['burn', 'increaseAllowance']` did not increase the code coverage. After analyzing the contract code, I found that the `increaseAllowance` function requires that the `allowance` is not already at the maximum value. To cover this branch, I generated a new sequence `['decreaseAllowance', 'increaseAllowance']`, which decreases the `allowance` before calling `increaseAllowance`.\n* `decreaseAllowance`: The previous sequence `['transfer', 'decreaseAllowance']` did not increase the code coverage. After analyzing the contract code, I found that the `decreaseAllowance` function requires that the `allowance` is not already at the minimum value. To cover this branch, I generated a new sequence `['burn', 'decreaseAllowance']`, which burns tokens before calling `decreaseAllowance`.\n* `burnFrom`: The previous sequence `['increaseAllowance', 'burnFrom']` did not increase the code coverage. After analyzing the contract code, I found that the `burnFrom` function requires that the `allowance` is sufficient. To cover this branch, I generated a new sequence `['decreaseAllowance', 'burnFrom']`, which decreases the `allowance` before calling `burnFrom`.\n\nNote that these sequences are different from the previous ones and are generated based on the analysis of the contract code."
