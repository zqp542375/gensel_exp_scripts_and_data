The execution stops at function transferFrom. The code coverage of this function so far is 73.16326530612245, far below the threshold. Please check the whole smart contract code to find a proper sequence for transferFrom.\nfeePoolTransfer:['mint', 'setFeePool', 'burn', 'feePoolTransfer'] is invalid. The execution stops at function feePoolTransfer. The code coverage of this function so far is 84.10351201478743. The code coverage can be further improved. Please find a proper sequence to increase code coverage for feePoolTransfer.\napprove:['increaseAllowance', 'burn', 'approve'] is a valid sequence. However,function approve still has the code coverage 84.53237410071942 below the threshold 98. The code coverage does not change after the execution of this sequence. Hence, please try to understand the contract code and find a proper sequence for approve.\nincreaseAllowance:['transferFrom', 'setFeePool', 'increaseAllowance'] is a valid sequence. However,function increaseAllowance still has the code coverage 88.88888888888889 below the threshold 98. The code coverage does not change after the execution of this sequence. Hence, please try to understand the contract code and find a proper sequence for increaseAllowance.\ndecreaseAllowance:['transfer', 'mint', 'setTxFee', 'decreaseAllowance'] is invalid. The execution stops at function setTxFee. The code coverage of this function so far is 88.88888888888889. The code coverage can be further improved. Please find a proper sequence to increase code coverage for decreaseAllowance.\nburnFrom:['transfer', 'mint', 'burn', 'burnFrom'] is invalid. The execution stops at function burn. The code coverage of this function so far is 91.88679245283019. The code coverage can be further improved. Please find a proper sequence to increase code coverage for burnFrom.\n\nBeing aware of the valid sequence(s) and feedback, for each target function in , please re-generate a different function sequence by selecting one from the candidate sequences of this target given in the Iteration 2. If no candidate sequence is found, then you should generate with your best effort a sequence (which has the length falling in [2, 4], starts with a start function, and ends with this target). If you can not generate a sequence, just use [] instead. Please return the sequences in json format: {\"target function\":function sequence,...}. Please also provide explanation after the json content."

The `transferFrom` function is called to transfer tokens from the owner's account to the recipient, `setTxFee` is called to set a non-zero transaction fee, and finally `transfer` is called to transfer tokens to the recipient.\n* `transferFrom`: The sequence [\"transfer\", \"mint\", \"transferFrom\"] is generated to cover the code path where the spender's allowance is increased and then used to transfer tokens from the owner's account. The `transfer` function is called to transfer tokens to the recipient, `mint` is called to increase the owner's balance, and finally `transferFrom` is called to transfer tokens from the owner's account to the recipient.\n* `feePoolTransfer`: The sequence [\"setTxFee\", \"burn\", \"feePoolTransfer\"] is generated to cover the code path where the fee pool's balance is increased and then used to transfer tokens to the recipient. The `setTxFee` function is called to set a non-zero transaction fee, `burn` is called to decrease the sender's balance, and finally `feePoolTransfer` is called to transfer tokens from the fee pool to the recipient.\n* `approve`: The sequence [\"setFeePool\", \"mint\", \"approve\"] is generated to cover the code path where the spender's allowance is increased and then used to approve the transfer of tokens. The `setFeePool` function is called to set the fee pool address, `mint` is called to increase the owner's balance, and finally `approve` is called to approve the transfer of tokens.\n* `increaseAllowance`: The sequence [\"burn\", \"setTxFee\", \"increaseAllowance\"] is generated to cover the code path where the spender's allowance is increased and then used to transfer tokens. The `burn` function is called to decrease the owner's balance, `setTxFee` is called to set a non-zero transaction fee, and finally `increaseAllowance` is called to increase the spender's allowance.\n* `decreaseAllowance`: The sequence [\"increaseAllowance\", \"burn\", \"decreaseAllowance\"] is generated to cover the code path where the spender's allowance is decreased and then used to transfer tokens. The `increaseAllowance` function is called to increase the spender's allowance, `burn` is called to decrease the owner's balance, and finally `decreaseAllowance` is called to decrease the spender's allowance.\n* `burnFrom`: The sequence [\"transferFrom\", \"mint\", \"burnFrom\"] is generated to cover the code path where the owner's balance is decreased and then used to burn tokens from the owner's account. The `transferFrom` function is called to transfer tokens from the owner's account to the recipient, `mint` is called to increase the owner's balance, and finally `burnFrom` is called to burn tokens from the owner's account."
