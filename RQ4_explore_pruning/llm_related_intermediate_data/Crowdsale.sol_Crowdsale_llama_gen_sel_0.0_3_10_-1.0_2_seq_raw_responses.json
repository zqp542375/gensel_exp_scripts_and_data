On contract Crowdsale with the Solidity code given at the end, for each target function in refund, withdraw, and invest, please generate a valid function sequence, the execution of which can have this target function executed. The length of this sequence must be fall in [2, 4] and the first function in the sequence must be from the start function(s): setOwner, setPhase, and invest, and the last function must be this target itself. If there is no such a sequence, just use [] instead. Please note that a sequence of type [A,A] is acceptable but you need to have a reason.

        "content": "Here is the JSON content with the valid function sequences:\n\n```\n{\n  \"refund\": [\"invest\", \"setPhase\", \"refund\"],\n  \"withdraw\": [\"invest\", \"setPhase\", \"withdraw\"],\n  \"invest\": [\"invest\"]\n}\n```\n\nExplanation:\n\n* For the target function `refund`, we need to satisfy the condition `phase == 2`. This can be achieved by calling `setPhase(2)` after `invest`. The `invest` function is necessary to increase the `raised` value, which is required to satisfy the condition `raised < goal` in `setPhase(2)`. Therefore, the sequence is [\"invest\", \"setPhase\", \"refund\"].\n* For the target function `withdraw`, we need to satisfy the condition `phase == 1`. This can be achieved by calling `setPhase(1)` after `invest`. The `invest` function is necessary to increase the `raised` value, which is required to satisfy the condition `raised >= goal` in `setPhase(1)`. Therefore, the sequence is [\"invest\", \"setPhase\", \"withdraw\"].\n* For the target function `invest`, since it has no preconditions, we can call it directly. Therefore, the sequence is simply [\"invest\"].\n\nNote that the sequence [\"invest\", \"invest\"] is also a valid sequence for the target function `invest`, but it is not included in the result because it is not the shortest possible sequence."
