However,function decreaseAllowance still has the code coverage 88.88888888888889 below the threshold 98. The code coverage does not change after the execution of this sequence. Hence, please try to understand the contract code and find a proper sequence for decreaseAllowance.\nburnFrom:['approve', 'burnFrom', 'burnFrom'] is a valid sequence. However,function burnFrom still has the code coverage 91.88679245283019 below the threshold 98. The code coverage does not change after the execution of this sequence. Hence, please try to understand the contract code and find a proper sequence for burnFrom.\n\nBeing aware of the valid sequence(s) and feedback, for each target function in , please re-generate a different function sequence by selecting one from the candidate sequences of this target given in the Iteration 2. If no candidate sequence is found, then you should generate with your best effort a sequence (which has the length falling in [2, 4], starts with a start function, and ends with this target). If you can not generate a sequence, just use [] instead. Please return the sequences in json format: {\"target function\":function sequence,...}. Please also provide explanation after the json content."

The idea is to set a transaction fee first, mint some tokens, and then transfer them.\n* For `transferFrom`, I generated a new sequence [\"mint\", \"transfer\", \"transferFrom\"] to try to increase the code coverage. The idea is to mint some tokens first, transfer them to an account, and then transfer them from that account.\n* For `feePoolTransfer`, I generated a new sequence [\"mint\", \"setFeePool\", \"feePoolTransfer\"] to try to increase the code coverage. The idea is to mint some tokens first, set a fee pool, and then transfer tokens to the fee pool.\n* For `approve`, I generated a new sequence [\"mint\", \"transfer\", \"approve\"] to try to increase the code coverage. The idea is to mint some tokens first, transfer them to an account, and then approve the transfer of tokens from that account.\n* For `increaseAllowance`, I generated a new sequence [\"mint\", \"transfer\", \"increaseAllowance\"] to try to increase the code coverage. The idea is to mint some tokens first, transfer them to an account, and then increase the allowance for that account.\n* For `decreaseAllowance`, I generated a new sequence [\"mint\", \"transfer\", \"decreaseAllowance\"] to try to increase the code coverage. The idea is to mint some tokens first, transfer them to an account, and then decrease the allowance for that account.\n* For `burnFrom`, I generated a new sequence [\"mint\", \"transfer\", \"burnFrom\"] to try to increase the code coverage. The idea is to mint some tokens first, transfer them to an account, and then burn tokens from that account.\n\nNote that these sequences are different from the previous ones and are generated based on the analysis of the contract code. However, it's possible that these sequences may not increase the code coverage significantly, and further analysis and testing may be needed to achieve the desired code coverage."
