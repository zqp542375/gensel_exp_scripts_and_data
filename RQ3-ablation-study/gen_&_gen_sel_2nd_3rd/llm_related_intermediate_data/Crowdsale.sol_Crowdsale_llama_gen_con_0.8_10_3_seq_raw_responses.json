On contract Crowdsale with the Solidity code given at the end, for each target function in refund, withdraw, and invest, please generate a valid function sequence, the execution of which can have this target function executed. The length of this sequence must be fall in [2, 4] and the first function in the sequence must be from the start function(s): setOwner, invest, and setPhase, and the last function must be this target itself. If there is no such a sequence, just use [] instead. Please note that a sequence of type [A,A] is acceptable but you need to have a reason.

        "content": "Here is the JSON content with the valid function sequences:\n```\n{\n  \"refund\": [\"invest\", \"setPhase\", \"refund\"],\n  \"withdraw\": [\"invest\", \"setPhase\", \"withdraw\"],\n  \"invest\": [\"setPhase\", \"invest\"]\n}\n```\nExplanation:\n\n**refund**: To execute the `refund` function, the contract needs to be in the \"Refund\" phase (phase 2). This can be achieved by first investing in the contract (`invest`), then setting the phase to 2 using `setPhase` (which requires the `raised` amount to be less than the goal and the current time to be after the end time). Finally, the `refund` function can be executed.\n\n**withdraw**: To execute the `withdraw` function, the contract needs to be in the \"Success\" phase (phase 1). This can be achieved by first investing in the contract (`invest`), then setting the phase to 1 using `setPhase` (which requires the `raised` amount to be greater than or equal to the goal). Finally, the `withdraw` function can be executed.\n\n**invest**: To execute the `invest` function, the contract just needs to be in the \"Active\" phase (phase 0), which is the initial phase. Therefore, the sequence can simply start with `setPhase` to ensure the phase is 0, and then `invest` can be executed.\n\nNote that the `setOwner` function is not necessary in any of these sequences, as it only changes the owner of the contract, which does not affect the execution of the other functions."
