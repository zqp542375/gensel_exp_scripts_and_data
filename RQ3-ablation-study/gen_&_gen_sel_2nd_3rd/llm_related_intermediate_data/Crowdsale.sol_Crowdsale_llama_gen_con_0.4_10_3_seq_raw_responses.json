On contract Crowdsale with the Solidity code given at the end, for each target function in refund, withdraw, and invest, please generate a valid function sequence, the execution of which can have this target function executed. The length of this sequence must be fall in [2, 4] and the first function in the sequence must be from the start function(s): setPhase, setOwner, and invest, and the last function must be this target itself. If there is no such a sequence, just use [] instead. Please note that a sequence of type [A,A] is acceptable but you need to have a reason.

Here's why:\n\t+ Initially, `phase` is 0 and `raised` is 0. The `invest` function is called, which increases `raised` and sets `investments[msg.sender]` to a non-zero value.\n\t+ Then, `setPhase` is called with `newPhase` equal to 2, which is allowed because `raised` is still less than `goal` and `now` is greater than `end` (assuming the contract has been deployed for more than 60 days). This sets `phase` to 2.\n\t+ Finally, `refund` can be called, which transfers the invested amount back to the sender and resets their investment to 0.\n* For the target function `withdraw`, a valid sequence is [\"invest\", \"setPhase\", \"withdraw\"]. Here's why:\n\t+ Initially, `phase` is 0 and `raised` is 0. The `invest` function is called, which increases `raised` and sets `investments[msg.sender]` to a non-zero value.\n\t+ Then, `setPhase` is called with `newPhase` equal to 1, which is allowed because `raised` is greater than or equal to `goal`. This sets `phase` to 1.\n\t+ Finally, `withdraw` can be called, which transfers the raised amount to the owner.\n* For the target function `invest`, a valid sequence is simply [\"invest\"]. Here's why:\n\t+ Initially, `phase` is 0 and `raised` is 0, which allows `invest` to be called directly. The `invest` function increases `raised` and sets `investments[msg.sender]` to a non-zero value.\n\nNote that the sequence [\"invest\", \"invest\"] is also a valid sequence for `invest`, but it's not included in the output because it's not the shortest possible sequence."
