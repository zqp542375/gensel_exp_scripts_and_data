Please find a proper sequence to increase code coverage for increaseAllowance.\ndecreaseAllowance:['approve', 'burn', 'decreaseAllowance'] is a valid sequence. However,function decreaseAllowance still has the code coverage 88.88888888888889 below the threshold 98. The code coverage does not change after the execution of this sequence. Hence, please try to understand the contract code and find a proper sequence for decreaseAllowance.\nburnFrom:['transfer', 'setFeePool', 'burnFrom'] is invalid. The execution stops at function burnFrom. The code coverage of this function so far is 91.88679245283019. The code coverage can be further improved. Please find a proper sequence to increase code coverage for burnFrom.\n\nBeing aware of the valid sequence(s) and feedback, for each target function in , please re-generate a different function sequence by selecting one from the candidate sequences of this target given in the Iteration 2. If no candidate sequence is found, then you should generate with your best effort a sequence (which has the length falling in [2, 4], starts with a start function, and ends with this target). If you can not generate a sequence, just use [] instead. Please return the sequences in json format: {\"target function\":function sequence,...}. Please also provide explanation after the json content."

This sequence covers different code paths than the previous sequence.\n* For `transferFrom`, I re-generated a new sequence `['setFeePool', 'changeFeePool', 'mint', 'approve', 'transferFrom']` that sets the fee pool, changes it, mints some tokens, approves a spender, and then transfers tokens from the owner. This sequence should cover more code paths than the previous sequence.\n* For `feePoolTransfer`, I re-generated a new sequence `['setFeePool', 'changeFeePool', 'mint', 'transfer', 'feePoolTransfer']` that sets the fee pool, changes it, mints some tokens, transfers them, and then transfers tokens from the fee pool. This sequence covers more code paths than the previous sequence.\n* For `approve`, I re-generated a new sequence `['transfer', 'burn', 'setTxFee', 'approve']` that transfers some tokens, burns some tokens, sets the transaction fee, and then approves a spender. This sequence covers different code paths than the previous sequence.\n* For `increaseAllowance`, I re-generated a new sequence `['approve', 'mint', 'transfer', 'increaseAllowance']` that approves a spender, mints some tokens, transfers them, and then increases the allowance. This sequence should cover more code paths than the previous sequence.\n* For `decreaseAllowance`, I re-generated a new sequence `['approve', 'mint', 'transfer', 'decreaseAllowance']` that approves a spender, mints some tokens, transfers them, and then decreases the allowance. This sequence should cover more code paths than the previous sequence.\n* For `burnFrom`, I re-generated a new sequence `['transfer', 'burn', 'setFeePool', 'burnFrom']` that transfers some tokens, burns some tokens, sets the fee pool, and then burns tokens from the owner. This sequence should cover more code paths than the previous sequence.\n\nNote that I generated new sequences that cover different code paths and are different from the previous sequences."
