On contract Crowdsale with the Solidity code given at the end, for each target function in refund, withdraw, and invest, please generate a valid function sequence, the execution of which can have this target function executed. The length of this sequence must be fall in [2, 4] and the first function in the sequence must be from the start function(s): invest, setPhase, and setOwner, and the last function must be this target itself. If there is no such a sequence, just use [] instead. Please note that a sequence of type [A,A] is acceptable but you need to have a reason.

        "content": "Here is the JSON content with the valid function sequences:\n\n```\n{\n  \"refund\": [\"invest\", \"setPhase\", \"refund\"],\n  \"withdraw\": [\"invest\", \"setPhase\", \"withdraw\"],\n  \"invest\": [\"invest\"]\n}\n```\n\nExplanation:\n\n* For the target function `refund`, we need to satisfy the condition `phase == 2`. This can be achieved by calling `setPhase(2)` after `invest`. However, `setPhase(2)` requires `raised < goal` and `now > end`. Since `end` is set to `now + 60 days` in the constructor, we cannot directly satisfy `now > end`. But we can assume that the contract has been deployed for more than 60 days, and then `invest` can be called to increase `raised`. After that, `setPhase(2)` can be called to set `phase` to 2, and finally `refund` can be called.\n* For the target function `withdraw`, we need to satisfy the condition `phase == 1`. This can be achieved by calling `setPhase(1)` after `invest`. However, `setPhase(1)` requires `raised >= goal`. Since `goal` is set to `100000 * (10**18)` in the contract, we can assume that multiple `invest` calls are made to increase `raised` to at least `goal`. After that, `setPhase(1)` can be called to set `phase` to 1, and finally `withdraw` can be called.\n* For the target function `invest`, we don't need any additional function calls to satisfy its conditions, since `phase` is initialized to 0 and `raised` is initialized to 0 in the contract. Therefore, the sequence is simply `[\"invest\"]`."
