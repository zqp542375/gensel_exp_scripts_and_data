The sequences provided are the minimum required to execute the target function.\n\nAlso, note that the modifier `whenMintingFinished` is used in some functions, which means that those functions can only be executed when `mintingFinished` is `true`. However, in the provided Solidity code, `mintingFinished` is initialized as `false` and can only be set to `true` by calling `finishMinting`. Therefore, for functions that require `mintingFinished` to be `true`, we need to include `finishMinting` in the sequence first.\n\nThe sequence `setMinter` followed by `finishMinting` can be used to set `mintingFinished` to `true`.
