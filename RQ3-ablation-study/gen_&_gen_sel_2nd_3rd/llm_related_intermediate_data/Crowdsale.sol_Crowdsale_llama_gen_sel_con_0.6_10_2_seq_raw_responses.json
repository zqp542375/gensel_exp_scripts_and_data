This can be done by calling `setPhase` with argument 2. Since `setPhase` requires `now > end`, we assume that the time has passed the end time. Therefore, the sequence is [\"setPhase\", \"2\", \"refund\"].\n* For the target function `withdraw`, we need to set the phase to 1 (Success) before calling `withdraw`. This can be done by calling `setPhase` with argument 1, but `setPhase` requires `raised >= goal`. To satisfy this condition, we need to call `invest` first to increase the `raised` amount. Therefore, the sequence is [\"invest\", \"setPhase\", \"1\", \"withdraw\"].\n* For the target function `invest`, since it is one of the start functions, we can call it directly without any preceding functions. Therefore, the sequence is simply [\"invest\"].\n\nNote that the sequence [\"invest\", \"invest\"] is also a valid sequence for the target function `invest`, but it is not included in the result because it is not the shortest sequence."

We choose the sequence `[\"setPhase\", \"withdraw\"]` because it is shorter than the second sequence and it does not include the `invest` function, which is not necessary to satisfy the condition for withdrawing funds.
