However,function approve still has the code coverage 84.53237410071942 below the threshold 98. The code coverage does not change after the execution of this sequence. Hence, please try to understand the contract code and find a proper sequence for approve.\nincreaseAllowance:['approve', 'setTxFee', 'increaseAllowance'] is a valid sequence. However,function increaseAllowance still has the code coverage 88.88888888888889 below the threshold 98. The code coverage does not change after the execution of this sequence. Hence, please try to understand the contract code and find a proper sequence for increaseAllowance.\ndecreaseAllowance:['approve', 'setFeePool', 'decreaseAllowance'] is a valid sequence. However,function decreaseAllowance still has the code coverage 88.88888888888889 below the threshold 98. The code coverage does not change after the execution of this sequence. Hence, please try to understand the contract code and find a proper sequence for decreaseAllowance.\nburnFrom:['setFeePool', 'changeFeePool', 'mint', 'burnFrom'] is a valid sequence. However,function burnFrom still has the code coverage 91.88679245283019 below the threshold 98. The code coverage does not change after the execution of this sequence. Hence, please try to understand the contract code and find a proper sequence for burnFrom.\n\nBeing aware of the valid sequence(s) and feedback, for each target function in , please re-generate a different function sequence by selecting one from the candidate sequences of this target given in the Iteration 2. If no candidate sequence is found, then you should generate with your best effort a sequence (which has the length falling in [2, 4], starts with a start function, and ends with this target). If you can not generate a sequence, just use [] instead. Please return the sequences in json format: {\"target function\":function sequence,...}. Please also provide explanation after the json content."

This new sequence `['setFeePool', 'changeFeePool', 'mint', 'transfer', 'transfer']` sets up a fee pool, changes it, mints some tokens, and then transfers twice, which should cover more code paths.\n* `transferFrom`: The previous sequence was invalid. This new sequence `['setFeePool', 'changeFeePool', 'mint', 'transferFrom']` sets up a fee pool, changes it, mints some tokens, and then transfers from, which should cover more code paths.\n* `feePoolTransfer`: The previous sequence did not cover the code sufficiently. This new sequence `['setFeePool', 'changeFeePool', 'mint', 'feePoolTransfer', 'feePoolTransfer']` sets up a fee pool, changes it, mints some tokens, and then transfers to the fee pool twice, which should cover more code paths.\n* `approve`: The previous sequence did not cover the code sufficiently. This new sequence `['mint', 'setTxFee', 'approve', 'approve']` mints some tokens, sets the transaction fee, and then approves twice, which should cover more code paths.\n* `increaseAllowance` and `decreaseAllowance`: The previous sequences did not cover the code sufficiently. These new sequences `['approve', 'setTxFee', 'increaseAllowance', 'increaseAllowance']` and `['approve', 'setFeePool', 'decreaseAllowance', 'decreaseAllowance']` approve the transfer, set the transaction fee or fee pool, and then increase or decrease the allowance twice, which should cover more code paths.\n* `burnFrom`: The previous sequence did not cover the code sufficiently. This new sequence `['setFeePool', 'changeFeePool', 'mint', 'burnFrom', 'burnFrom']` sets up a fee pool, changes it, mints some tokens, and then burns from twice, which should cover more code paths.\n\nNote that these sequences are generated based on the contract code and the feedback from the previous iteration. They are designed to cover more code paths and increase the code coverage."
