On contract Crowdsale with the Solidity code given at the end, for each target function in refund, withdraw, and invest, please generate a valid function sequence, the execution of which can have this target function executed. The length of this sequence must be fall in [2, 4] and the first function in the sequence must be from the start function(s): setPhase, invest, and setOwner, and the last function must be this target itself. If there is no such a sequence, just use [] instead. Please note that a sequence of type [A,A] is acceptable but you need to have a reason.

        "content": "Here is the JSON output:\n\n```\n{\n  \"refund\": [\"setPhase\", \"setPhase\", \"refund\"],\n  \"withdraw\": [\"invest\", \"setPhase\", \"withdraw\"],\n  \"invest\": [\"setOwner\", \"invest\"]\n}\n```\n\nExplanation:\n\n* For the target function `refund`, the sequence is `[\"setPhase\", \"setPhase\", \"refund\"]`. The reason is that we need to set the phase to 2 (Refund) by calling `setPhase` twice, first to set the phase to 1 (Success) and then to set it to 2 (Refund). This is because the `setPhase` function requires that the phase can only be set to 2 if the raised amount is less than the goal and the end time has passed. By calling `setPhase` twice, we can satisfy this condition. Finally, we can call `refund` to execute the target function.\n* For the target function `withdraw`, the sequence is `[\"invest\", \"setPhase\", \"withdraw\"]`. The reason is that we need to invest some amount first to increase the `raised` amount, and then set the phase to 1 (Success) by calling `setPhase`. This is because the `withdraw` function requires that the phase is 1 (Success). Finally, we can call `withdraw` to execute the target function.\n* For the target function `invest`, the sequence is `[\"setOwner\", \"invest\"]`. The reason is that we can simply call `setOwner` to set the owner (although this is not necessary), and then call `invest` to execute the target function. This sequence is acceptable because the `invest` function does not have any specific requirements that need to be satisfied before it can be called.\n\nNote that the length of each sequence is between 2 and 4, as required."
