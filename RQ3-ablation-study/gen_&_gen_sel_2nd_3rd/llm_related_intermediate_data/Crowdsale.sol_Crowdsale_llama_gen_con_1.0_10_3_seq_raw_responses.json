For the target function \"refund\", no sequence can be generated because the condition `phase==2` requires `now>end` and `raised<goal`, which cannot be guaranteed by the execution of any sequence of functions. Therefore, an empty sequence is returned.\n\n2. For the target function \"withdraw\", the sequence [\"invest\", \"setPhase\"] can lead to its execution. The reason is as follows:\n   - The \"invest\" function is called first, which increases the `raised` value and sets the investment for the sender.\n   - Then, the \"setPhase\" function is called with `newPhase==1`, which sets the phase to 1 (Success) because `raised>=goal`.\n   - Now, the condition `phase==1` for the \"withdraw\" function is satisfied, and it can be executed.\n\n3. For the target function \"invest\", no sequence is needed because it can be executed directly, and the condition `phase==0 && raised<goal` is already satisfied by the initial values of `phase` and `raised`. Therefore, an empty sequence (but technically [invest]) is returned.\n\nNote that the sequence [A, A] is not applicable in this case, but it could be valid in other cases where a function can be called repeatedly to achieve some desired state."
