On contract Crowdsale with the Solidity code given at the end, for each target function in refund, withdraw, and invest, please generate a valid function sequence, the execution of which can have this target function executed. The length of this sequence must be fall in [2, 4] and the first function in the sequence must be from the start function(s): invest, setOwner, and setPhase, and the last function must be this target itself. If there is no such a sequence, just use [] instead. Please note that a sequence of type [A,A] is acceptable but you need to have a reason. Please return the sequences in json format: {\"target function\":function sequence,...}. Please also provide explanation after the json content.

Here's why:\n\t+ Initially, the contract is in phase 0 (Active) and the goal has not been reached.\n\t+ The \"invest\" function is called, which increases the raised amount and updates the investments mapping.\n\t+ The \"setPhase\" function is called with a new phase of 2 (Refund), which is allowed because the raised amount is still less than the goal and the end time has passed (assuming the current time is after the end time).\n\t+ Finally, the \"refund\" function is called, which transfers the investment back to the sender and resets the investment amount.\n* For the target function \"withdraw\", the sequence [\"invest\", \"setPhase\", \"withdraw\"] can lead to its execution. Here's why:\n\t+ Initially, the contract is in phase 0 (Active) and the goal has not been reached.\n\t+ The \"invest\" function is called, which increases the raised amount and updates the investments mapping.\n\t+ The \"setPhase\" function is called with a new phase of 1 (Success), which is allowed because the raised amount has reached or exceeded the goal.\n\t+ Finally, the \"withdraw\" function is called, which transfers the raised amount to the owner.\n* For the target function \"invest\", the sequence [\"invest\"] can lead to its execution. This might seem trivial, but it's a valid sequence because the \"invest\" function can be called multiple times, and each call will update the investments mapping and increase the raised amount."
