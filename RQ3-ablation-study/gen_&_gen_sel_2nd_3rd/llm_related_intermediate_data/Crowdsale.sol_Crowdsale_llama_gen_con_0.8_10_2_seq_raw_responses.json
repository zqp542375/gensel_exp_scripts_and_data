Since `end` is set to 60 days from the constructor, we can't directly satisfy `now > end`. However, we can set the phase to 2 by calling `setPhase(2)`. Therefore, the sequence is `[\"setPhase\", \"2\", \"refund\"]`.\n* For the target function `withdraw`, we need to set the phase to 1, which requires `raised >= goal`. We can achieve this by calling `invest()` to increase the `raised` amount. After that, we can set the phase to 1 by calling `setPhase(1)`. Finally, we can call `withdraw()`. Therefore, the sequence is `[\"invest\", \"setPhase\", \"1\", \"withdraw\"]`.\n* For the target function `invest`, it can be executed directly without any prerequisites.
