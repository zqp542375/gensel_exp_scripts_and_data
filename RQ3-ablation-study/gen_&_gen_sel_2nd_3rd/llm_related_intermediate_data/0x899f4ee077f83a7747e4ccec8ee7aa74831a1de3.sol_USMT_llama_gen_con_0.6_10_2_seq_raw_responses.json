This should increase the code coverage of the `transferFrom` function.\n* `feePoolTransfer`: I added another `feePoolTransfer` to the sequence to cover the code path where the fee pool transfers tokens to itself. This should increase the code coverage of the `feePoolTransfer` function.\n* `approve`: I simplified the sequence to just `mint` and `approve`, as the previous sequence was not valid.\n* `increaseAllowance` and `decreaseAllowance`: I kept the same sequences as before, as they were already valid.\n* `burnFrom`: I kept the same sequence as before, as it was already valid.\n\nNote that I made some changes to the sequences based on the feedback and the contract code. I hope these new sequences will increase the code coverage of the target functions."
