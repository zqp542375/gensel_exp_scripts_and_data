However,function burnFrom still has the code coverage 91.88679245283019 below the threshold 98. The code coverage does not change after the execution of this sequence. Hence, please try to understand the contract code and find a proper sequence for burnFrom.\n\nBeing aware of the valid sequence(s) and feedback, for each target function in , please re-generate a different function sequence by selecting one from the candidate sequences of this target given in the Iteration 2. If no candidate sequence is found, then you should generate with your best effort a sequence (which has the length falling in [2, 4], starts with a start function, and ends with this target). If you can not generate a sequence, just use [] instead. Please return the sequences in json format: {\"target function\":function sequence,...}. Please also provide explanation after the json content."

This sequence exercises the transfer logic with a non-zero balance.\n* `transferFrom`: Similarly to `transfer`, I chose a sequence that calls `mint` first, and then calls `transferFrom`.\n* `feePoolTransfer`: I chose a sequence that calls `mint` and `transfer` first, which updates the balance of the fee pool account, and then calls `feePoolTransfer`. This sequence exercises the fee pool transfer logic with a non-zero balance.\n* `approve`: I chose a sequence that calls `burn` first, which updates the balance of the account, and then calls `approve`. This sequence exercises the approval logic with a zero balance.\n* `increaseAllowance`: Similarly to `approve`, I chose a sequence that calls `burn` first, and then calls `increaseAllowance`.\n* `decreaseAllowance`: Similarly to `increaseAllowance`, I chose a sequence that calls `burn` first, and then calls `decreaseAllowance`.\n* `burnFrom`: I chose a sequence that calls `transfer` first, which updates the balance of the account, and then calls `burnFrom`. This sequence exercises the burn from logic with a non-zero balance.\n\nNote that I made sure to choose sequences that are different from the previous ones and exercise different code paths in each target function."
