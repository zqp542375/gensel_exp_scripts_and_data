This sequence ensures that the `approve` function is executed with different inputs, increasing the code coverage.\n* For `increaseAllowance` and `decreaseAllowance`, we need to mint some tokens first using `mint`, then approve the spender using `approve`, then increase or decrease the allowance using `increaseAllowance` or `decreaseAllowance`, and finally increase or decrease the allowance again using `increaseAllowance` or `decreaseAllowance`. This sequence ensures that the `increaseAllowance` and `decreaseAllowance` functions are executed with different inputs, increasing the code coverage.\n* For `burnFrom`, we need to mint some tokens first using `mint`, then approve the spender using `approve`, then burn some tokens from the owner using `burnFrom`, and finally burn some tokens from the owner again using `burnFrom`. This sequence ensures that the `burnFrom` function is executed with different inputs, increasing the code coverage.\n\nNote that some of these sequences may seem redundant or trivial, but they are necessary to increase the code coverage of the target functions. By executing these sequences, we can ensure that the target functions are executed with different inputs, increasing the overall code coverage of the contract."
