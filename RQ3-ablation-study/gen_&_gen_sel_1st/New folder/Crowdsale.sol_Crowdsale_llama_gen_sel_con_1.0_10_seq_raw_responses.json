Therefore, a valid sequence is to call `setPhase` with the argument 2, then call `invest` to make an investment, and finally call `refund` to refund the investment.\n\nFor the `withdraw` function, we need to set the phase to 1 (Success) and ensure that the `invest` function has been called before, so that there are funds to withdraw. Therefore, a valid sequence is to call `invest` to make an investment, then call `setPhase` with the argument 1, and finally call `withdraw` to withdraw the funds.\n\nFor the `invest` function, since it has no dependencies on other functions, a valid sequence is simply to call `invest` itself.\n\nNote that we can have a sequence of type [A,A] (e.g., \"invest\", \"invest\") because the Solidity language allows it. In this case, calling `invest` multiple times is a valid sequence, but it doesn't provide any additional benefits.\n\nAlso note that the state variables `phase`, `raised`, `end`, and `owner` are initialized or assigned values in the constructor function. We used these default values to analyze the conditions that need to be satisfied to cover the target functions. If a state variable has no value, we used the default value 0 instead."

We also noticed that the sequence [\"invest\", \"setPhase\"] was valid, but it didn't lead to the `refund` function.\n\nUpon re-examining the smart contract code, we realized that the `refund` function requires the `phase` to be set to 2 (Refund) before it can be executed. Therefore, a valid sequence is to simply call `setPhase` with the argument 2, and then call `refund`. This sequence is different from the previous ones and meets the requirements.\n\nWe didn't choose the sequence [\"invest\", \"setPhase\", \"refund\"] because it's similar to the previous invalid sequence, and we want to try a different approach.\n\nWe also didn't choose the sequence [\"invest\", \"invest\"] because it doesn't provide any additional benefits and doesn't lead to the `refund` function.\n\nWe kept the sequence [\"setPhase\", \"refund\"] because it's new, valid, and meets the requirements.\n\nNote that we used our best effort to generate a new sequence that is different from the previous ones and meets the requirements. If we couldn't generate a sequence, we would have returned an empty array `[]` instead."
