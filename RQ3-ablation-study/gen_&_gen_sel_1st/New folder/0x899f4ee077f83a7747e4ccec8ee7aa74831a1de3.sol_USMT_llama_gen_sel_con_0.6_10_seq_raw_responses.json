Therefore, the sequence starts with `approve` to approve a spender, followed by `increaseAllowance` or `decreaseAllowance` to modify the allowance.\n* `burnFrom`: The `burnFrom` function requires that the owner has a balance. Therefore, the sequence starts with `mint` to give the owner a balance, followed by `burnFrom` to burn tokens from the owner's account.\n\nNote that these sequences are not the only possible sequences, but they are one possible way to satisfy the conditions for each target function."

Hence, please try to understand the contract code and find a proper sequence for increaseAllowance.\ndecreaseAllowance:['setFeePool', 'changeFeePool', 'mint', 'decreaseAllowance'] is a valid sequence. However,function decreaseAllowance still has the code coverage 88.88888888888889 below the threshold 98. The code coverage does not change after the execution of this sequence. Hence, please try to understand the contract code and find a proper sequence for decreaseAllowance.\nburnFrom:['setFeePool', 'changeFeePool', 'mint', 'burnFrom'] is a valid sequence. However,function burnFrom still has the code coverage 91.88679245283019 below the threshold 98. The code coverage does not change after the execution of this sequence. Hence, please try to understand the contract code and find a proper sequence for burnFrom.\n\nBeing aware of the valid sequence(s) and feedback, for each target function in , please re-generate a different function sequence by selecting one from the candidate sequences of this target given in the Iteration 2. If no candidate sequence is found, then you should generate with your best effort a sequence (which has the length falling in [2, 4], starts with a start function, and ends with this target). If you can not generate a sequence, just use [] instead. Please return the sequences in json format: {\"target function\":function sequence,...}. Please also provide explanation after the json content."
