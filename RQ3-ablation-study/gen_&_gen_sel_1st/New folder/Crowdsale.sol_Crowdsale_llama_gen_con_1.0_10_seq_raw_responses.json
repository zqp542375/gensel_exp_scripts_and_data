Therefore, a valid sequence is to call `setPhase` with the argument 2, then call `invest` to make an investment, and finally call `refund` to refund the investment.\n\nFor the `withdraw` function, we need to set the phase to 1 (Success) and ensure that the `invest` function has been called before, so that there are funds to withdraw. Therefore, a valid sequence is to call `invest` to make an investment, then call `setPhase` with the argument 1, and finally call `withdraw` to withdraw the funds.\n\nFor the `invest` function, since it has no dependencies on other functions, a valid sequence is simply to call `invest` itself.\n\nNote that we can have a sequence of type [A,A] (e.g., \"invest\", \"invest\") because the Solidity language allows it. In this case, calling `invest` multiple times is a valid sequence, but it doesn't provide any additional benefits.\n\nAlso note that the state variables `phase`, `raised`, `end`, and `owner` are initialized or assigned values in the constructor function. We used these default values to analyze the conditions that need to be satisfied to cover the target functions. If a state variable has no value, we used the default value 0 instead."

Please check the whole smart contract code to find a proper sequence for refund.\n. \nValid sequences(s): ['invest', 'setPhase'], ['invest', 'invest'], and ['invest', 'setPhase', 'withdraw']. \n Bad sequence(s): ['invest'] is a bad sequence as there should be at least two functions in a sequence..\nBeing aware of the valid sequence(s) and feedback, for each target function in refund, please re-generate a valid function sequence, the execution of which can have this target function executed. The length of this sequence must be fall in [2, 4] and the first function in the sequence must be from the start function(s): invest, setPhase, and setOwner, and the last function must be this target itself.

After re-examining the code, we found that a valid sequence is to call `invest` to make an investment, then call `setPhase` with the argument 2 (Refund), and finally call `refund` to refund the investment.\n\nFor the `withdraw` function, the sequence remains the same as before, which is to call `invest` to make an investment, then call `setPhase` with the argument 1 (Success), and finally call `withdraw` to withdraw the funds.\n\nFor the `invest` function, since it has no dependencies on other functions, a valid sequence is to call `invest` twice. This sequence is valid because calling `invest` multiple times is allowed in the Solidity language, and it helps to increase the code coverage of the `invest` function.\n\nNote that we removed `setOwner` from the start functions because it does not affect the execution of the target functions. Also, we made sure that the length of each sequence falls in the range [2, 4] and that the first function in each sequence is from the start functions (`invest`, `setPhase`, or `setOwner`)."
