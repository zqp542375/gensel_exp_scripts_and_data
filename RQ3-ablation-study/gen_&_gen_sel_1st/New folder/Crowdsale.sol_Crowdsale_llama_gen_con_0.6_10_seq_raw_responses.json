On contract Crowdsale with the Solidity code given at the end, for each target function in refund, withdraw, and invest, please generate a valid function sequence, the execution of which can have this target function executed. The length of this sequence must be fall in [2, 4] and the first function in the sequence must be from the start function(s): setPhase, setOwner, and invest, and the last function must be this target itself. If there is no such a sequence, just use [] instead. Please note that a sequence of type [A,A] is acceptable but you need to have a reason. Please return the sequences in json format: {\"target function\":function sequence,...}. Please also provide explanation after the json content. Solidity code:pragma solidity ^0.4.25;\ncontract Crowdsale {\n  uint256 goal=100000*(10**18);\n  uint256 phase=0;\n  // 0: Active , 1: Success , 2: Refund\n  uint256 raised;\n  uint256 end;   address owner;\n  mapping(address=>uint256) investments ;\n  constructor() public{\n    end=now+60 days ;\n    owner=msg.sender ;\n }\n  function invest() public payable{\n    require(phase==0 && raised<goal);\n    investments[msg.sender]+=msg.value ;\n    raised+=msg.value ;\n  }\n  function setPhase(uint256 newPhase) public {\n    require (\n    (newPhase==1 && raised>=goal) ||\n    (newPhase==2 && raised<goal && now>end));\n    phase=newPhase ;\n  }\n  function setOwner(address newOwner) public {      \n    owner=newOwner ;\n  }\n  function withdraw() public {\n    require(phase==1);\n    owner.transfer(raised);\n  }\n  function refund() public {\n    require(phase==2);\n    msg.sender.transfer(investments[msg.sender]);\n    investments[msg.sender]=0;\n  }\n}\n"

        "content": "Here is the JSON output:\n\n```\n{\n  \"refund\": [\"invest\", \"setPhase\", \"refund\"],\n  \"withdraw\": [\"invest\", \"setPhase\", \"withdraw\"],\n  \"invest\": [\"invest\"]\n}\n```\n\nExplanation:\n\n* For the target function \"refund\", the valid sequence is [\"invest\", \"setPhase\", \"refund\"]. The reason is that we need to first invest some amount to have a non-zero investment value, then set the phase to 2 (Refund) by calling setPhase with the correct conditions (raised < goal and now > end), and finally call refund to transfer the investment back to the sender.\n* For the target function \"withdraw\", the valid sequence is [\"invest\", \"setPhase\", \"withdraw\"]. The reason is that we need to first invest some amount to reach the goal, then set the phase to 1 (Success) by calling setPhase with the correct conditions (raised >= goal), and finally call withdraw to transfer the raised amount to the owner.\n* For the target function \"invest\", the valid sequence is simply [\"invest\"] because it can be called directly without any preconditions.\n\nNote that the sequence [\"invest\", \"invest\"] is not considered because it does not provide any additional value in terms of satisfying the preconditions for the target functions."
