Since `end` is set to `now + 60 days` in the constructor, we can't directly satisfy `now > end`. However, we can set the phase to 2 by calling `setPhase(2)` after waiting for 60 days. To simulate this, we assume that the sequence starts with `setPhase(2)`, which sets the phase to 2. Then, the `refund` function can be executed.\n\nFor the `withdraw` function, we need to set the phase to 1, which requires `raised >= goal`. We can achieve this by calling `invest()` with a value greater than or equal to `goal - raised`. Since `raised` is initially 0, we can invest any amount greater than or equal to `goal`. After setting the phase to 1 using `setPhase(1)`, we can execute the `withdraw` function.\n\nFor the `invest` function, it can be executed directly without any prior function calls, as its only requirement is that the phase is 0 and `raised < goal`, both of which are true initially.\n\nNote that the sequence for `withdraw` has a length of 4, which is within the specified range of [2, 4]. The sequence for `refund` has a length of 3, and the sequence for `invest` has a length of 1."

This sequence starts with `invest`, which is a start function, and ends with `refund`. Although `invest` does not directly affect the phase, it increases the `raised` amount, which might help in setting the phase to 2 later. Then, `setPhase` can be used to set the phase to 2, and finally, `refund` can be executed.\n\nFor the `withdraw` function, we choose the sequence `['setPhase', 'withdraw']` from the candidate sequences. This sequence starts with `setPhase`, which is a start function, and ends with `withdraw`. Since `setPhase` can set the phase to 1, which is the requirement for `withdraw`, we can execute `withdraw` immediately after setting the phase.\n\nNote that these sequences are different from the previous ones, and they only contain function names defined in the source code.
