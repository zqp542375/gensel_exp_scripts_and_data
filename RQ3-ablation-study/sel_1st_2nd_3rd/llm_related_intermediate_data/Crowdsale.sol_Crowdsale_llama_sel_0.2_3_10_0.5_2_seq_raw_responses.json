By calling `setPhase` with `newPhase=2`, we can set the phase to Refund, and then call `refund` to execute the refund logic.\n\nFor the `withdraw` function, I selected the first candidate sequence `['setPhase', 'withdraw']` because it is the most straightforward way to satisfy the condition `phase==1` required by the `withdraw` function. By calling `setPhase` with `newPhase=1`, we can set the phase to Success, and then call `withdraw` to execute the withdrawal logic.\n\nFor the `invest` function, I selected the sequence `['invest']` because it is the only way to call the `invest` function, which does not require any specific conditions to be satisfied. The `invest` function can be called directly, and it will execute the investment logic.\n\nNote that I did not select the second candidate sequence `['invest', 'setPhase', 'refund']` for the `refund` function because it is not necessary to call `invest` before calling `setPhase` and `refund`. Similarly, I did not select the second candidate sequence `['invest', 'setPhase', 'withdraw']` for the `withdraw` function because it is not necessary to call `invest` before calling `setPhase` and `withdraw`."

After symbolically executing the sequence(s) generated in Iteration 1:\n The target function(s):withdraw.\nValid sequences(s): ['setPhase', 'refund'] and ['invest', 'invest']\nFeedback: withdraw:['setPhase', 'withdraw'] is invalid.

This condition is necessary to enable the withdrawal of funds.\n\nTo satisfy this condition, I added the `invest` function to the sequence, which allows the contract to receive funds and increase the `raised` variable. By calling `invest` before `setPhase`, we can ensure that the `raised` variable is greater than or equal to the `goal`, allowing the phase to be set to Success (1). Finally, calling `withdraw` will execute the withdrawal logic.\n\nNote that I did not select the sequence `['setPhase', 'refund']` because it sets the phase to Refund (2), which is not the desired phase for withdrawal. I also did not select the sequence `['invest', 'invest']` because it does not set the phase to Success (1), which is required for withdrawal."
