Hence, please try to understand the contract code and find a proper sequence for increaseAllowance.\ndecreaseAllowance:['mint', 'approve', 'decreaseAllowance'] is a valid sequence. However,function decreaseAllowance still has the code coverage 88.88888888888889 below the threshold 98. The code coverage does not change after the execution of this sequence. Hence, please try to understand the contract code and find a proper sequence for decreaseAllowance.\nburnFrom:['mint', 'approve', 'burnFrom'] is a valid sequence. However,function burnFrom still has the code coverage 91.88679245283019 below the threshold 98. The code coverage does not change after the execution of this sequence. Hence, please try to understand the contract code and find a proper sequence for burnFrom.\n\nBeing aware of the valid sequence(s) and feedback, for each target function in changeFeePool, transfer, transferFrom, feePoolTransfer, approve, increaseAllowance, decreaseAllowance, and burnFrom, please re-generate a different function sequence by selecting one from the candidate sequences of this target given in the Iteration 2. If no candidate sequence is found, then you should generate with your best effort a sequence (which has the length falling in [2, 4], starts with a start function, and ends with this target). If you can not generate a sequence, just use [] instead. Please return the sequences in json format: {\"target function\":function sequence,...}. Please also provide explanation after the json content."

This sequence is generated based on the assumption that the contract needs to set the transaction fee and fee pool address before changing the fee pool address.\n* `transfer`: The `mint` function is called first to mint some tokens, then `transfer` is called twice to transfer tokens and increase the code coverage. This sequence is generated to improve the code coverage of the `transfer` function.\n* `transferFrom`: The `mint` function is called first to mint some tokens, then `approve` is called to approve the spender to transfer tokens, then `transfer` is called to transfer tokens, and finally `transferFrom` is called to transfer tokens from the sender to the recipient. This sequence is generated to improve the code coverage of the `transferFrom` function.\n* `feePoolTransfer`: The `setFeePool` function is called first to set the fee pool address, then `mint` is called to mint some tokens, and finally `feePoolTransfer` is called to transfer tokens from the fee pool. This sequence is generated to improve the code coverage of the `feePoolTransfer` function.\n* `approve`: The `mint` function is called first to mint some tokens, then `increaseAllowance` is called to increase the allowance of the spender, and finally `approve` is called to approve the spender to transfer tokens. This sequence is generated to improve the code coverage of the `approve` function.\n* `increaseAllowance`: The `mint` function is called first to mint some tokens, then `approve` is called to approve the spender to transfer tokens, then `decreaseAllowance` is called to decrease the allowance of the spender, and finally `increaseAllowance` is called to increase the allowance of the spender. This sequence is generated to improve the code coverage of the `increaseAllowance` function.\n* `decreaseAllowance`: The `mint` function is called first to mint some tokens, then `approve` is called to approve the spender to transfer tokens, then `increaseAllowance` is called to increase the allowance of the spender, and finally `decreaseAllowance` is called to decrease the allowance of the spender. This sequence is generated to improve the code coverage of the `decreaseAllowance` function.\n* `burnFrom`: The `mint` function is called first to mint some tokens, then `approve` is called to approve the spender to transfer tokens, then `burnFrom` is called twice to burn tokens from the sender's account and increase the code coverage. This sequence is generated to improve the code coverage of the `burnFrom` function.\n\nNote that these sequences are generated based on the assumption that the contract needs to perform certain actions before calling the target function. The actual sequences may vary depending on the specific requirements of the contract."
