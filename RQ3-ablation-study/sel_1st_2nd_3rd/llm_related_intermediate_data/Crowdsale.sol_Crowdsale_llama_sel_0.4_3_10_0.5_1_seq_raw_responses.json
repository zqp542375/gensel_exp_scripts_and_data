We can achieve this by calling `setPhase(2)` before calling `refund`. Therefore, the sequence `[\"setPhase\", \"refund\"]` is generated.\n* For the `withdraw` function, we need to satisfy the condition `phase == 1`. We can achieve this by calling `setPhase(1)` before calling `withdraw`. Therefore, the sequence `[\"setPhase\", \"withdraw\"]` is generated.\n* For the `invest` function, no additional conditions need to be satisfied, so the sequence `[\"invest\"]` is generated.\n\nNote that the `invest` function can be called directly without any additional setup, as it only requires that the contract is in the active phase (i.e., `phase == 0`), which is the default phase set in the constructor.\n\nAlso, the `setPhase` function is used to transition the contract to the desired phase, which is necessary to satisfy the conditions for the `refund` and `withdraw` functions."

Upon re-examining the contract code, I noticed that the `withdraw` function requires `phase == 1` and also that `raised >= goal`. The `invest` function can be used to increase the `raised` amount, which can help satisfy the condition for `withdraw`. Therefore, I generated a new sequence `[\"invest\", \"setPhase\", \"withdraw\"]`, which starts with `invest` to increase the `raised` amount, followed by `setPhase` to transition to phase 1, and finally `withdraw` to execute the target function.\n\nNote that the `invest` function is used to increase the `raised` amount, which is necessary to satisfy the condition for `withdraw`. The `setPhase` function is used to transition to phase 1, which is also required for `withdraw`."
