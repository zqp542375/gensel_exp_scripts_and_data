Hence, please try to understand the contract code and find a proper sequence for decreaseAllowance.\nburnFrom:['burn', 'burnFrom'] is a valid sequence. However,function burnFrom still has the code coverage 91.88679245283019 below the threshold 98. The code coverage does not change after the execution of this sequence. Hence, please try to understand the contract code and find a proper sequence for burnFrom.\n\nBeing aware of the valid sequence(s) and feedback, for each target function in transfer, transferFrom, feePoolTransfer, approve, increaseAllowance, decreaseAllowance, and burnFrom, please re-generate a different function sequence by selecting one from the candidate sequences of this target given in the Iteration 2. If no candidate sequence is found, then you should generate with your best effort a sequence (which has the length falling in [2, 4], starts with a start function, and ends with this target). If you can not generate a sequence, just use [] instead. Please return the sequences in json format: {\"target function\":function sequence,...}. Please also provide explanation after the json content."

After analyzing the contract code, I found that the `transfer` function requires a sufficient balance in the sender's account and a sufficient transaction fee. The `setTxFee` function can be used to set the transaction fee, and then the `mint` function can be used to increase the sender's balance before calling `transfer`.\n* `feePoolTransfer`: The previous sequence `['setFeePool', 'mint', 'feePoolTransfer']` did not increase the code coverage. After analyzing the contract code, I found that the `feePoolTransfer` function requires that the `feePool` is already set and has a sufficient balance. The `setFeePool` function can be used to set the `feePool`, and then the `mint` function can be used to increase the `feePool`'s balance. Additionally, the `transfer` function can be used to transfer tokens to the `feePool` before calling `feePoolTransfer`.\n* `transferFrom`: The previous sequence `['approve', 'transfer', 'transferFrom']` did not increase the code coverage. After analyzing the contract code, I found that the `transferFrom` function requires a sufficient allowance in the sender's account and a sufficient transaction fee. The `setTxFee` function can be used to set the transaction fee, and then the `approve` function can be used to set an allowance, and then the `transfer` function can be used to transfer tokens from the sender to another account, which will also increase the sender's allowance before calling `transferFrom`.\n* `approve`: The previous sequence `['increaseAllowance', 'approve']` did not increase the code coverage. After analyzing the contract code, I found that the `approve` function requires a sufficient balance in the sender's account. The `increaseAllowance` function can be used to increase the sender's allowance, and then the `transfer` function can be used to transfer tokens to the sender, which will also increase the sender's balance before calling `approve`.\n* `increaseAllowance`: The previous sequence `['transfer', 'increaseAllowance']` did not increase the code coverage. After analyzing the contract code, I found that the `increaseAllowance` function requires a sufficient balance in the sender's account and a sufficient allowance. The `transfer` function can be used to transfer tokens to the sender, which will also increase the sender's balance, and then the `transferFrom` function can be used to transfer tokens from the sender to another account, which will also increase the sender's allowance before calling `increaseAllowance`.\n* `decreaseAllowance`: The previous sequence `['transferFrom', 'decreaseAllowance']` did not increase the code coverage. After analyzing the contract code, I found that the `decreaseAllowance` function requires a sufficient allowance in the sender's account and a sufficient balance. The `transferFrom` function can be used to transfer tokens from the sender to another account, which will also decrease the sender's allowance, and then the `transfer` function can be used to transfer tokens to the sender, which will also increase the sender's balance before calling `decreaseAllowance`.\n* `burnFrom`: The previous sequence `['burn', 'burnFrom']` did not increase the code coverage. After analyzing the contract code, I found that the `burnFrom` function requires a sufficient balance in the sender's account. The `mint` function can be used to increase the sender's balance, and then the `burn` function can be used to burn tokens from the sender's account, which will also decrease the sender's balance before calling `burnFrom`."
