However,function burnFrom still has the code coverage 91.88679245283019 below the threshold 98. The code coverage does not change after the execution of this sequence. Hence, please try to understand the contract code and find a proper sequence for burnFrom.\n\nBeing aware of the valid sequence(s) and feedback, for each target function in transfer, transferFrom, feePoolTransfer, approve, increaseAllowance, decreaseAllowance, and burnFrom, please re-generate a different function sequence by selecting one from the candidate sequences of this target given in the Iteration 2. If no candidate sequence is found, then you should generate with your best effort a sequence (which has the length falling in [2, 4], starts with a start function, and ends with this target). If you can not generate a sequence, just use [] instead. Please return the sequences in json format: {\"target function\":function sequence,...}. Please also provide explanation after the json content."

The previous sequence `[\"mint\", \"transfer\"]` did not increase the code coverage, so a new sequence is tried.\n* For `transferFrom`, the sequence `[\"mint\", \"setTxFee\", \"approve\", \"transferFrom\"]` is selected because `mint` sets up the balance of the sender, `setTxFee` sets up the transaction fee, `approve` sets up the allowance, and `transferFrom` can then transfer the tokens. The previous sequence `[\"mint\", \"approve\", \"transferFrom\"]` did not increase the code coverage, so a new sequence is tried.\n* For `feePoolTransfer`, the sequence `[\"setFeePool\", \"mint\", \"feePoolTransfer\"]` is selected because `setFeePool` sets up the fee pool, `mint` sets up the balance of the fee pool, and `feePoolTransfer` can then transfer the tokens. The previous sequence `[\"mint\", \"feePoolTransfer\"]` was invalid, so a new sequence is tried.\n* For `approve`, the sequence `[\"mint\", \"setTxFee\", \"transfer\", \"approve\"]` is selected because `mint` sets up the balance of the sender, `setTxFee` sets up the transaction fee, `transfer` sets up the transfer, and `approve` can then approve the allowance. The previous sequence `[\"transfer\", \"approve\"]` did not increase the code coverage, so a new sequence is tried.\n* For `increaseAllowance`, the sequence `[\"mint\", \"setTxFee\", \"transfer\", \"increaseAllowance\"]` is selected because `mint` sets up the balance of the sender, `setTxFee` sets up the transaction fee, `transfer` sets up the transfer, and `increaseAllowance` can then increase the allowance. The previous sequence `[\"transfer\", \"increaseAllowance\"]` did not increase the code coverage, so a new sequence is tried.\n* For `decreaseAllowance`, the sequence `[\"mint\", \"setTxFee\", \"transfer\", \"increaseAllowance\", \"decreaseAllowance\"]` is selected because `mint` sets up the balance of the sender, `setTxFee` sets up the transaction fee, `transfer` sets up the transfer, `increaseAllowance` sets up the allowance, and `decreaseAllowance` can then decrease the allowance. The previous sequence `[\"transfer\", \"increaseAllowance\", \"decreaseAllowance\"]` did not increase the code coverage, so a new sequence is tried.\n* For `burnFrom`, the sequence `[\"mint\", \"setTxFee\", \"burnFrom\"]` is selected because `mint` sets up the balance of the sender, `setTxFee` sets up the transaction fee, and `burnFrom` can then burn the tokens. The previous sequence `[\"mint\", \"burnFrom\"]` did not increase the code coverage, so a new sequence is tried.\n\nNote that these new sequences may not be the only possible sequences, but they are one possible sequence that tries to increase the code coverage for each target function."
