This can be achieved by calling `setPhase` with `newPhase = 2` first, which requires `raised < goal` and `now > end`. Since `raised` is initialized to 0 and `end` is set to 60 days in the future, we can assume that `now > end` will be true eventually. Therefore, the sequence `[\"setPhase\", \"refund\"]` is a valid one.\n* For the `withdraw` function, we need to satisfy the condition `phase == 1`. This can be achieved by calling `setPhase` with `newPhase = 1` first, which requires `raised >= goal`. Since `raised` is initialized to 0, we need to increase it to at least `goal` before calling `setPhase`. However, there is no function that can directly increase `raised`. Therefore, we can only assume that `raised` will be increased somehow, and the sequence `[\"setPhase\", \"withdraw\"]` is a valid one.\n* For the `invest` function, we need to satisfy the condition `phase == 0 && raised < goal`. Since `phase` is initialized to 0 and `raised` is initialized to 0, the condition is already satisfied. Therefore, the sequence `[\"invest\"]` is a valid one.\n\nNote that the sequences are generated based on the assumptions that the conditions will be satisfied eventually, and the functions will be called in a way that satisfies the requirements. In a real-world scenario, additional testing and verification would be necessary to ensure that the sequences are correct."

We notice that the valid sequences `['setPhase', 'refund']` and `['invest', 'invest']` do not help us directly. However, we can try to increase the `raised` variable to satisfy the condition `phase == 1` in `setPhase`. We can do this by calling `invest` multiple times. Therefore, we generate a new sequence `[\"invest\", \"setPhase\", \"withdraw\"]`. This sequence first increases the `raised` variable by calling `invest`, then sets the phase to 1 by calling `setPhase`, and finally calls `withdraw`.\n\nNote that we assume that the `invest` function will be called multiple times to increase the `raised` variable to at least `goal`. We also assume that the `setPhase` function will be called with `newPhase = 1` to set the phase to 1."
