We can achieve this by calling `setPhase(2)` before calling `refund`. Therefore, the sequence `[\"setPhase\", \"refund\"]` is a valid one.\n* For the `withdraw` function, we need to satisfy the condition `phase==1`. We can achieve this by calling `setPhase(1)` before calling `withdraw`. Therefore, the sequence `[\"setPhase\", \"withdraw\"]` is a valid one.\n* For the `invest` function, there are no preconditions that need to be satisfied. Therefore, we can simply call `invest` directly, and the sequence `[\"invest\"]` is a valid one.\n\nNote that we didn't need to use the `invest` function as a precursor to `refund` or `withdraw`, as the conditions for these functions can be satisfied directly by calling `setPhase`. Also, we didn't need to use `setOwner` in any of the sequences, as it doesn't affect the preconditions of the target functions."

We need to increase the `raised` value to satisfy this condition.\n* We noticed that the `invest` function increases the `raised` value. Therefore, we can call `invest` before calling `setPhase(1)` to increase the `raised` value.\n* By calling `invest` twice, we can increase the `raised` value to be greater than or equal to the `goal` value, satisfying the condition required by `setPhase(1)`.\n* After calling `setPhase(1)`, we can finally call `withdraw` to satisfy the condition `phase==1` required by `withdraw`.\n\nNote that we used the valid sequence `[\"invest\", \"invest\"]` as a starting point to generate the new sequence for `withdraw`. We added `setPhase` to this sequence to satisfy the condition required by `withdraw`."
