Please find a proper sequence to increase code coverage for burnFrom.\n\nBeing aware of the valid sequence(s) and feedback, for each target function in transfer, feePoolTransfer, approve, transferFrom, increaseAllowance, decreaseAllowance, and burnFrom, please re-generate a different function sequence by selecting one from the candidate sequences of this target given in the Iteration 2. If no candidate sequence is found, then you should generate with your best effort a sequence (which has the length falling in [2, 4], starts with a start function, and ends with this target). If you can not generate a sequence, just use [] instead. Please return the sequences in json format: {\"target function\":function sequence,...}. Please also provide explanation after the json content."
