Therefore, the sequence [\"setPhase\", \"refund\"] is sufficient.\n\nFor the `withdraw` function, we need to ensure that the `phase` is set to 1, which can be achieved by calling `setPhase` with argument 1. Therefore, the sequence [\"setPhase\", \"withdraw\"] is sufficient.\n\nFor the `invest` function, it can be executed independently without any prior function calls, as it only requires the `phase` to be 0, which is the initial value. Therefore, the sequence [\"invest\"] is sufficient.\n\nNote that the `setOwner` function is not included in any of the sequences, as it does not affect the execution of the target functions. Also, the `now` variable is not controllable, so we rely on the initial value of `end` being set to `now+60 days` and do not include any sequences that depend on the passage of time.\n\nIn this iteration, all sequences are relatively short and straightforward, as the contract is relatively simple. In future iterations, more complex scenarios may arise."

After symbolically executing the sequence(s) generated in Iteration 1:\n The target function(s):withdraw.\nValid sequences(s): ['setPhase', 'refund'] and ['invest', 'invest']\nFeedback: withdraw:['setPhase', 'withdraw'] is invalid. The execution stops at function withdraw. The code coverage of this function so far is 31.32530120481928, far below the threshold. Please check the whole smart contract code to find a proper sequence for withdraw.\n\nBeing aware of the valid sequence(s) and feedback, for each target function in withdraw, please re-generate a different function sequence by selecting one from the candidate sequences of this target given in the Iteration 2.

        "content": "Here is the JSON output with the re-generated function sequences:\n```\n{\n  \"withdraw\": [\"invest\", \"setPhase\", \"withdraw\"]\n}\n```\nExplanation:\n\nThe previous sequence [\"setPhase\", \"withdraw\"] failed to execute the `withdraw` function, indicating that the `phase` being set to 1 is not sufficient. Upon reviewing the contract code, we notice that the `withdraw` function requires the `raised` amount to be greater than or equal to the `goal`. This condition is not met when only setting the phase.\n\nWe also observe that the `invest` function increases the `raised` amount. Therefore, we generate a new sequence that includes an `invest` call before setting the phase to 1. This should increase the `raised` amount, making it possible for the `withdraw` function to execute successfully.\n\nNote that we select [\"invest\", \"setPhase\", \"withdraw\"] instead of [\"invest\", \"invest\", \"setPhase\", \"withdraw\"] because the problem statement asks to select one from the candidate sequences. However, if no candidate sequence is provided, the generated sequence could be [\"invest\", \"invest\", \"setPhase\", \"withdraw\"]."
