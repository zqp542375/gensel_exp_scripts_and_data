Therefore, the sequence [\"setPhase\", \"refund\"] is sufficient.\n\nFor the `withdraw` function, we need to ensure that the `phase` is set to 1, which can be achieved by calling `setPhase` with argument 1. Therefore, the sequence [\"setPhase\", \"withdraw\"] is sufficient.\n\nFor the `invest` function, it can be executed independently without any preconditions, so the sequence [\"invest\"] is sufficient.\n\nNote that we don't need to include `setOwner` in any of the sequences because it does not affect the behavior of the other functions.\n\nAlso, we don't need to include multiple `setPhase` calls or other redundant calls in the sequences because the conditions for the target functions can be satisfied with a single `setPhase` call or a single `invest` call."

This means that the `phase` is set to 1, but the `raised` amount is not sufficient to satisfy the condition in the `withdraw` function.\n\nAfter analyzing the valid sequences for other target functions, we notice that the sequence [\"invest\", \"invest\"] is valid, which means that investing twice increases the `raised` amount.\n\nWe can leverage this knowledge to generate a new sequence for the `withdraw` function. By investing once before setting the phase to 1, we can increase the `raised` amount, making it more likely to satisfy the condition in the `withdraw` function. Therefore, the sequence [\"invest\", \"setPhase\", \"withdraw\"] is generated.\n\nNote that we don't need to include `refund` in the sequence because it would set the phase to 2, which is not a valid precursor to the `withdraw` function."
