This sequence makes sense because the `refund` function requires the `phase` to be 2, which can be achieved by calling `setPhase` with the argument 2. The `setPhase` function can be called with the argument 2 when the `raised` amount is less than the `goal` and the current time is greater than the `end` time.\n\nFor the `withdraw` target function, I selected the sequence `[\"setPhase\", \"withdraw\"]` from the candidate sequences. This sequence makes sense because the `withdraw` function requires the `phase` to be 1, which can be achieved by calling `setPhase` with the argument 1. The `setPhase` function can be called with the argument 1 when the `raised` amount is greater than or equal to the `goal`.\n\nFor the `invest` target function, I selected the sequence `[\"invest\"]` because the `invest` function does not require any specific conditions to be met before it can be called. It can be called directly.\n\nNote that I did not select the sequence `[\"invest\", \"setPhase\", \"refund\"]` for the `refund` target function because it is not necessary to call `invest` before calling `setPhase` and `refund`. Similarly, I did not select the sequence `[\"invest\", \"setPhase\", \"withdraw\"]` for the `withdraw` target function because it is not necessary to call `invest` before calling `setPhase` and `withdraw`."

After symbolically executing the sequence(s) generated in Iteration 1:\n The target function(s):withdraw.\nValid sequences(s): ['setPhase', 'refund'] and ['invest', 'invest']\nFeedback: withdraw:['setPhase', 'withdraw'] is invalid. The execution stops at function withdraw. The code coverage of this function so far is 31.32530120481928, far below the threshold.

However, the `setPhase` function alone cannot guarantee this condition.\n\nUpon re-examining the contract code, I noticed that the `invest` function can increase the `raised` amount, which can potentially meet the condition for `phase` to be 1. Therefore, I generated a new sequence `[\"invest\", \"setPhase\", \"withdraw\"]`, which starts with the `invest` function to increase the `raised` amount, followed by `setPhase` to set the `phase` to 1, and finally `withdraw` to transfer the funds.\n\nThis sequence has a higher chance of meeting the conditions required by the `withdraw` function, and it starts with a start function (`invest`) and ends with the target function (`withdraw`)."
