This sequence makes sense because the contract needs to be in the \"Refund\" phase (2) to allow refunds, which can be achieved by calling `setPhase` after an investment has been made (`invest`). The investment is necessary to set `raised` to a value less than the `goal`, which is a requirement for entering the \"Refund\" phase.\n* For the target function `withdraw`, I selected the sequence `['setPhase', 'withdraw']`. This sequence is valid because the contract needs to be in the \"Success\" phase (1) to allow withdrawals, which can be achieved by calling `setPhase` directly. Since `raised` is initialized to 0 and `goal` is a large value, it's not possible to reach the \"Success\" phase through investments alone.\n* For the target function `invest`, I selected the sequence `['invest']`. Since `invest` is a start function, it can be called directly without any prerequisites. This sequence is valid because the contract is initially in the \"Active\" phase (0), which allows investments.\n\nI didn't use the `setOwner` function in any of the sequences because it doesn't affect the contract's phase or the requirements for the target functions."

The execution stops at function withdraw. The code coverage of this function so far is 31.32530120481928, far below the threshold.

This sequence is different from the previous one and takes into account the valid sequences found in Iteration 2.\n* The idea behind this sequence is to first make two investments (`invest`, `invest`) to increase the `raised` amount, which is initially 0. This will bring the contract closer to reaching the `goal`.\n* Then, I call `setPhase` to transition the contract to the \"Success\" phase (1), which is a requirement for `withdraw` to be executable.\n* Finally, I call `withdraw` to execute the target function.\n* This sequence has a higher chance of increasing the code coverage of the `withdraw` function, as it exercises the contract's logic more thoroughly.\n\nNote that I didn't use the `refund` function in the sequence, as it's not necessary for the `withdraw` function to be executable. Also, I used two `invest` calls to increase the `raised` amount, but this number can be adjusted depending on the specific requirements of the contract."
