This sequence makes sense because `invest` is needed to increase the `raised` variable, which is required to be less than the `goal` for `setPhase` to set the phase to 2 (Refund). Then, `refund` can be called to refund the investment.\n* For the target function `withdraw`, I selected the sequence `['setPhase', 'withdraw']`. This sequence is straightforward because `setPhase` needs to set the phase to 1 (Success) by satisfying the condition `raised >= goal`, and then `withdraw` can be called to transfer the funds to the owner.\n* For the target function `invest`, I selected the sequence `['invest']`. Since `invest` is a payable function and can be called directly, no additional setup is needed.\n\nNote that the sequence `['invest']` for the target function `invest` might seem trivial, but it is a valid sequence because `invest` can be called directly without any prior setup. If you'd like, I can generate an alternative sequence for `invest`, but it would likely involve unnecessary additional function calls."

After symbolically executing the sequence(s) generated in Iteration 1:\n The target function(s):withdraw.\nValid sequences(s): ['invest', 'setPhase'], ['invest', 'invest'], and ['invest', 'setPhase', 'refund']\nFeedback: withdraw:['setPhase', 'withdraw'] is invalid. The execution stops at function withdraw. The code coverage of this function so far is 31.32530120481928, far below the threshold. Please check the whole smart contract code to find a proper sequence for withdraw.\n\nBeing aware of the valid sequence(s) and feedback, for each target function in withdraw, please re-generate a different function sequence by selecting one from the candidate sequences of this target given in the Iteration 2. If no candidate sequence is found, then you should generate with your best effort a sequence (which has the length falling in [2, 4], starts with a start function, and ends with this target).

This sequence is based on the valid sequences provided in the feedback, specifically `['invest', 'invest']` and `['invest', 'setPhase']`.\n* The idea behind this sequence is to call `invest` twice to increase the `raised` variable, which is required to be greater than or equal to the `goal` for `setPhase` to set the phase to 1 (Success). Then, `setPhase` is called to set the phase, and finally `withdraw` is called to transfer the funds to the owner.\n* This sequence has a higher chance of covering more code paths in the `withdraw` function, which had a low code coverage of 31.32% previously.\n\nNote that this sequence is longer than the original sequence `['setPhase', 'withdraw']`, but it is necessary to increase the code coverage of the `withdraw` function. If you'd like, I can try to generate an alternative sequence, but it may not be as effective in covering more code paths."
