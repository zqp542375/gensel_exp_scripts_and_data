Hence, please try to understand the contract code and find a proper sequence for approve.\nincreaseAllowance:['approve', 'increaseAllowance', 'decreaseAllowance'] is bad sequence as the target function increaseAllowance is not the last function in the sequence.\ndecreaseAllowance:['increaseAllowance', 'approve', 'decreaseAllowance'] is a valid sequence. However,function decreaseAllowance still has the code coverage 88.88888888888889 below the threshold 98. The code coverage does not change after the execution of this sequence. Hence, please try to understand the contract code and find a proper sequence for decreaseAllowance.\nburnFrom:['transfer', 'increaseAllowance', 'burnFrom'] is invalid. The execution stops at function burnFrom. The code coverage of this function so far is 91.88679245283019. The code coverage can be further improved. Please find a proper sequence to increase code coverage for burnFrom.\n\nBeing aware of the valid sequence(s) and feedback, for each target function in transfer, transferFrom, feePoolTransfer, approve, increaseAllowance, decreaseAllowance, and burnFrom, please re-generate a different function sequence by selecting one from the candidate sequences of this target given in the Iteration 2. If no candidate sequence is found, then you should generate with your best effort a sequence (which has the length falling in [2, 4], starts with a start function, and ends with this target). If you can not generate a sequence, just use [] instead. Please return the sequences in json format: {\"target function\":function sequence,...}. Please also provide explanation after the json content."

Here's a brief explanation for each target function:\n\n* `transfer`: The new sequence `[\"mint\", \"approve\", \"transfer\"]` is chosen because `mint` mints new tokens, which may trigger the `transfer` function to transfer tokens. `approve` is added to the sequence to approve the allowance of the spender.\n* `transferFrom`: The new sequence `[\"burnFrom\", \"transferFrom\"]` is chosen because `burnFrom` burns tokens, which may trigger the `transferFrom` function to transfer tokens.\n* `feePoolTransfer`: The new sequence `[\"setTxFee\", \"feePoolTransfer\"]` is chosen because `setTxFee` sets the transaction fee, which is required by `feePoolTransfer`.\n* `approve`: The new sequence `[\"burnFrom\", \"approve\"]` is chosen because `burnFrom` burns tokens, which may trigger the `approve` function to approve the allowance of the spender.\n* `increaseAllowance`: The new sequence `[\"transfer\", \"increaseAllowance\"]` is chosen because `transfer` transfers tokens, which may trigger the `increaseAllowance` function to increase the allowance of the spender.\n* `decreaseAllowance`: The new sequence `[\"transferFrom\", \"decreaseAllowance\"]` is chosen because `transferFrom` transfers tokens, which may trigger the `decreaseAllowance` function to decrease the allowance of the spender.\n* `burnFrom`: The new sequence `[\"transferFrom\", \"increaseAllowance\", \"burnFrom\"]` is chosen because `transferFrom` transfers tokens, which may trigger the `burnFrom` function to burn tokens. `increaseAllowance` is added to the sequence to increase the allowance of the spender.\n\nNote that these sequences are not unique and may not be the only possible sequences that can increase the code coverage of the target functions."
