This sequence makes sense because the `refund` function requires the `phase` to be 2, and the `setPhase` function can set the `phase` to 2 if the `raised` amount is less than the `goal` and the current time is greater than the `end` time.\n\nFor the `withdraw` target function, I selected the sequence `[\"setPhase\", \"withdraw\"]` from the candidate sequences. This sequence makes sense because the `withdraw` function requires the `phase` to be 1, and the `setPhase` function can set the `phase` to 1 if the `raised` amount is greater than or equal to the `goal`.\n\nFor the `invest` target function, I selected the sequence `[\"invest\"]` since it is already a valid sequence on its own. The `invest` function does not require any specific conditions to be met, so there is no need to add any additional functions to the sequence.\n\nI did not generate any new sequences beyond the candidate sequences provided, as they already met the conditions for each target function. However, I did validate the provided candidate sequences to ensure they were correct. If no candidate sequences were provided, I would have attempted to generate new sequences that meet the conditions for each target function."

After symbolically executing the sequence(s) generated in Iteration 1:\n The target function(s):withdraw.\nValid sequences(s): ['setPhase', 'refund'] and ['invest', 'invest']\nFeedback: withdraw:['setPhase', 'withdraw'] is invalid. The execution stops at function withdraw. The code coverage of this function so far is 31.32530120481928, far below the threshold.

This sequence is different from the previous one `[\"setPhase\", \"withdraw\"]`, which was invalid.\n\nThe new sequence starts with the `invest` function, which allows the contract to collect funds and increase the `raised` amount. This is necessary because the `withdraw` function requires the `phase` to be 1, which can only be set by the `setPhase` function if the `raised` amount is greater than or equal to the `goal`.\n\nAfter the `invest` function is executed, the `setPhase` function can be called to set the `phase` to 1, which meets the condition for the `withdraw` function.\n\nThis new sequence should allow the `withdraw` function to be executed successfully, increasing the code coverage of the contract."
