This sequence makes sense because `setPhase` needs to be called to set the phase to 2 (Refund) before `refund` can be called.\n* For the `withdraw` target function, I selected the sequence `[\"setPhase\", \"withdraw\"]` from the candidate sequences. This sequence makes sense because `setPhase` needs to be called to set the phase to 1 (Success) before `withdraw` can be called.\n* For the `invest` target function, I selected the sequence `[\"invest\"]` because `invest` can be called directly without any preconditions. However, I could have also generated a sequence like `[\"setPhase\", \"invest\"]` or `[\"setOwner\", \"invest\"]`, but these sequences are not necessary to satisfy the preconditions of `invest`.\n\nNote that I did not generate sequences with length greater than 2 because the preconditions of the target functions can be satisfied with shorter sequences. Also, I did not use the `setOwner` function as the first function in any sequence because it does not affect the preconditions of the target functions."

Specifically, `withdraw` requires that the phase is 1 (Success) and the `raised` amount is greater than or equal to the `goal`.\n* I noticed that the valid sequence `[\"invest\", \"invest\"]` was able to increase the `raised` amount, which is a necessary condition for `withdraw`.\n* Therefore, I generated a new sequence `[\"invest\", \"setPhase\", \"withdraw\"]` that combines the effect of increasing the `raised` amount with setting the phase to 1 (Success) using `setPhase`.\n* This sequence starts with `invest`, which is a start function, and ends with `withdraw`, which is the target function. The length of the sequence is 3, which falls within the allowed range of [2, 4].\n\nNote that I did not select the sequence `[\"setPhase\", \"withdraw\"]` again because it was already marked as invalid. I also did not select the sequence `[\"invest\", \"invest\"]` because it does not end with the target function `withdraw`."
