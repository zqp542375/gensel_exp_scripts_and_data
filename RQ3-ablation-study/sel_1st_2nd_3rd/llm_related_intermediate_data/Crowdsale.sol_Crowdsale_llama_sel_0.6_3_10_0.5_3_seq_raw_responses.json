This sequence makes sense because `setPhase` can set the phase to 2 (Refund) if the conditions are met (raised < goal and now > end), and then `refund` can be called to refund the investment.\n* For the `withdraw` function, I selected the sequence `[\"setPhase\", \"withdraw\"]` from the candidate sequences. This sequence makes sense because `setPhase` can set the phase to 1 (Success) if the conditions are met (raised >= goal), and then `withdraw` can be called to withdraw the funds.\n* For the `invest` function, I selected the sequence `[\"invest\"]` because `invest` can be called directly without any preconditions. This sequence may seem trivial, but it's a valid sequence that allows the `invest` function to be executed.\n\nNote that I didn't generate any new sequences that weren't already in the candidate set, as the existing sequences seemed sufficient to cover the target functions. If I had to generate new sequences, I would have considered the preconditions of each function and tried to create a sequence that satisfies those conditions."

The execution stops at function withdraw. The code coverage of this function so far is 31.32530120481928, far below the threshold.

This new sequence starts with `invest`, which can increase the `raised` amount, making it possible to set the phase to 1 (Success) using `setPhase`. Finally, `withdraw` can be called to withdraw the funds.\n* I chose `invest` as the starting function because it can increase the `raised` amount, which is a necessary condition for setting the phase to 1 (Success) using `setPhase`. Without `invest`, the `raised` amount would remain 0, and `setPhase` would not be able to set the phase to 1.\n* This sequence has a good chance of increasing the code coverage of the `withdraw` function, as it exercises the `invest` function and the `setPhase` function with a specific value (1) that allows the `withdraw` function to be executed.\n\nNote that I didn't select the sequence `[\"invest\", \"invest\"]` because it doesn't seem to contribute to the execution of the `withdraw` function. The `withdraw` function requires the phase to be set to 1 (Success), which is not achieved by calling `invest` twice."
