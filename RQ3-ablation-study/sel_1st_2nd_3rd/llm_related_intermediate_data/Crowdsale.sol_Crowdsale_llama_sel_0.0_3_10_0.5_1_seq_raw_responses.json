This sequence is valid because `setPhase` can set the phase to 2 (Refund) if the conditions are met (raised < goal and now > end), and then `refund` can be called to refund the investment.\n* For the `withdraw` target function, I selected the sequence `[\"setPhase\", \"withdraw\"]` from the candidate sequences. This sequence is valid because `setPhase` can set the phase to 1 (Success) if the conditions are met (raised >= goal), and then `withdraw` can be called to withdraw the funds.\n* For the `invest` target function, I selected the sequence `[\"invest\"]` because `invest` can be called directly without any preconditions. However, this sequence is not very useful because it doesn't provide any additional coverage. A better sequence would be `[\"setPhase\", \"invest\"]`, but this sequence is not possible because `setPhase` can only set the phase to 1 or 2, and `invest` requires the phase to be 0 (Active). Therefore, I left the sequence as `[\"invest\"]`.\n\nNote that the sequences generated are not exhaustive, and there may be other valid sequences that can cover the target functions. Additionally, the sequences generated are based on the assumption that the state variables have their default values (e.g., `phase` is 0, `raised` is 0, etc.) unless explicitly initialized or assigned in the constructor function."

After symbolically executing the sequence(s) generated in Iteration 1:\n The target function(s):withdraw.\nValid sequences(s): ['setPhase', 'refund'] and ['invest', 'invest']\nFeedback: withdraw:['setPhase', 'withdraw'] is invalid.

This is likely because the `phase` is not set to 1 (Success) before calling `withdraw`.\n* Upon reviewing the contract code, I noticed that `invest` can increase the `raised` amount, which can help meet the condition for setting the `phase` to 1 (Success).\n* Therefore, I generated a new sequence `[\"invest\", \"setPhase\", \"withdraw\"]`. This sequence first calls `invest` to increase the `raised` amount, then calls `setPhase` to set the `phase` to 1 (Success), and finally calls `withdraw` to withdraw the funds.\n* This sequence has a good chance of covering the `withdraw` function because it sets up the necessary conditions for `withdraw` to succeed.\n\nNote that I did not select the sequence `['invest', 'invest']` from the valid sequences because it does not end with the target function `withdraw`."
