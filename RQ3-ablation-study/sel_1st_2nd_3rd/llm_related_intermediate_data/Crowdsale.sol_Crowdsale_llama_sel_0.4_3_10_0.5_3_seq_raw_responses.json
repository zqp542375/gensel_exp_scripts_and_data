On contract Crowdsale with the Solidity code given at the end, for each target function in refund, withdraw, and invest, please generate a function sequence by selecting one from the candidate sequences of this target in {refund:[['setPhase', 'refund'], ['invest', 'setPhase', 'refund']]\nwithdraw:[['setPhase', 'withdraw'], ['invest', 'setPhase', 'withdraw']]\ninvest:[['setPhase', 'invest']]\n}. If no candidate sequence is found, then you should generate with your best effort a sequence. The length of this sequence must be fall in [2, 4] and the first function in the sequence must be from the start function(s): invest, setPhase, and setOwner, and the last function must be this target itself. If you can not generate such a sequence, just use [] instead. Please note that a sequence of type [A,A] is acceptable but you need to have a good reason. Please return the sequences in json format: {\"target function\":function sequence,...}. Please also provide explanation after the json content.

For the target function `refund`, I selected the sequence `['invest', 'setPhase', 'refund']` from the candidate sequences. This sequence makes sense because `invest` is called to increase the `raised` amount, then `setPhase` is called to set the phase to 2 (Refund) when the `raised` amount is less than the `goal` and the `end` time has passed. Finally, `refund` is called to refund the investment.\n2. For the target function `withdraw`, I selected the sequence `['invest', 'setPhase', 'withdraw']` from the candidate sequences. This sequence makes sense because `invest` is called to increase the `raised` amount, then `setPhase` is called to set the phase to 1 (Success) when the `raised` amount is greater than or equal to the `goal`. Finally, `withdraw` is called to withdraw the funds.\n3. For the target function `invest`, I selected the sequence `['setPhase', 'invest']` from the candidate sequences. This sequence makes sense because `setPhase` is called to set the phase to 0 (Active), and then `invest` is called to invest funds.\n\nNote that I didn't generate a new sequence for `invest` because the existing candidate sequence `['setPhase', 'invest']` already satisfies the conditions. The `setPhase` function is called to set the phase to 0 (Active), which is the initial phase, and then `invest` is called to invest funds. This sequence is valid because the `invest` function requires the phase to be 0 (Active) and the `raised` amount to be less than the `goal`."
